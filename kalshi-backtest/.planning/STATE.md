# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-04)

**Core value:** Accurately simulate any Kalshi trading strategy against historical data so you can validate signal quality and optimize parameters before risking real capital.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Data Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 (Data Foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 5
Status: Executing Phase 1

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Use DuckDB (not SQLite) as analytical store — columnar, zero-server, 8x faster for time-series range queries
- [Init]: Physical lookahead separation — `result` column in DB schema must be enforced before any simulation work begins
- [Init]: Kalshi SDK `/historical/*` endpoint coverage unverified — may need full httpx implementation for historical candlesticks

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Kalshi SDK historical endpoint coverage unverified — verify which `/historical/*` endpoints `kalshi-python` 2.1.4 actually wraps at plan time; httpx fallback is ready
- [Phase 1]: Kalshi rate limit specifics not confirmed — implement tenacity with conservative defaults, adjust after first real ingestion run
- [Phase 4]: Insider Tracker signal output format needs review before designing the adapter's input contract
